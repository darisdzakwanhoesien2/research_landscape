This study aims to examine local governments’ (LGOs) use of social media (SM) in disclosing environmental actions/plans/information as a new way to improve accountability to citizens to obtain organisational legitimacy and the related sentiment of citizens’ judgements. Design/methodology/approach This paper analyses the content of 39 Italian LGOs’ public pages on Facebook. After the distinction between five classes of environmental issues (air, water, energy, waste and territory), an initial study is performed to detect possible sub-topics applying latent Dirichlet allocation. Having a list of posts related to specific environmental themes, the researchers computed the sentiment of citizens’ comments. To measure sentiment, two different approaches were implemented: one based on a lexicon dictionary and the other based on convolutional neural networks. Findings Facebook is used by LGOs to disclose environmental issues, focussing on their main interest in obtaining organisational legitimacy, and the analysis shows an increasing impact of Web 2.0 in the direct interaction of LGOs with citizens. On the other hand, there is a clear divergence of interest on environmental topics between LGOs and citizens in a dialogic accountability framework. Practical implications Sentiment analysis (SA) could be used by politicians, but also by managers/entrepreneurs in the business sector, to analyse stakeholders’ judgements of their communications/actions and plans on corporate social responsibility. This tool gives a result on time (i.e. not months or years after, as for the reporting system). It is cheaper than a survey and allows a first “photograph” of stakeholders’ sentiment. It can also be a useful tool for supporting, developing and improving environmental reporting. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is one of the first to apply SA to environmental disclosure via SM in the public sphere. The study links modern techniques in natural language processing and machine learning with the important aspects of environmental communication between LGOs and citizens.",112426899,35,76,,

The immense advancements in this field urged the researchers to devise new techniques and approaches, each sermonizing a different research analysis/question, that cope with upcoming issues and complex scenarios of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis. Therefore, this survey emphasized on the issues and challenges that are related to extraction of different aspects and their relevant sentiments, relational mapping between aspects, interactions, dependencies, and contextual-semantic relationships between different data objects for improved sentiment accuracy, and prediction of sentiment evolution dynamicity. A rigorous overview of the recent progress is summarized based on whether they contributed towards highlighting and mitigating the issue of Aspect Extraction, Aspect Sentiment Analysis or Sentiment Evolution. The reported performance for each scrutinized study of Aspect Extraction and Aspect Sentiment Analysis is also given, showing the quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach.

Agrell",(missing journal),2016,"Category captainship, the approach where retailers use manufacturer-retailer collaboration, is a common way to leverage resources and capabilities in order to improve the sales/shelf performance ratio. However, evidence suggests that the depth and effectiveness of category captains and collaboration in retail are not as high as theory or best practice would predict. Suppliers and retailers suspect each other of opportunistic behaviour detrimental to both. In a stylized dyadic supply chain model prior to the effective contracting of the category captain, we show why information asymmetry between both is preferred: the retailer will hint at or develop retaliatory power to keep the supplier in check whereas the supplier will try to extract a rent by taking advantage of available information about relationship specific investment. We model single-period interaction when the retailer has to invest in relationship specific assets and alternative category manager grooming. We provide normative and positive support both to the captain's potential opportunistic behaviour as well as the retailer's investment decision in alternative captains and monitoring ability. In a two-period extension, we show how the retailer can discipline the captain ex ante. The model and its results complement and extend research in pre-contractual category captainship and supplier-retailer collaboration and coordination.

Currently, community governance is mostly based on reactive response, which lacks timely and proactive technical means for emergency monitoring. The easiest way for residents to contact their properties is to call the property call center, and the call centers of many properties store many speech data. However, text sentiment classification in community scenes still faces challenges such as small corpus size, one-sided sentiment feature extraction, and insufficient sentiment classification accuracy. To address such problems, we propose a novel community speech text sentiment classification algorithm combining two-channel features and attention mechanisms to obtain effective emotional information and provide decision support for the emergency management of public emergencies. Firstly, text vectorization based on word position information is proposed, and a SKEP-based community speech–text enhancement model is constructed to obtain the corresponding corpus. Secondly, a dual-channel emotional text feature extraction method that integrates spatial and temporal sequences is proposed to extract diverse emotional features effectively. Finally, an improved cross-entropy loss function suitable for community speech text is proposed for model training, which can achieve sentiment analysis and obtain all aspects of community conditions. The proposed method is conducive to improving community residents’ sense of happiness, satisfaction, and fulfillment, enhancing the effectiveness and resilience of urban community governance.",253440534,4,19,,
10.18653/v1/2022.nlp4pi-1.19,Transformers-Based Approach for a Sustainability Term-Based Sentiment Analysis (STBSA),"B. Sandwidi, Suneer Pallitharammal Mukkolakal",NLP4PI,2022,"Traditional sentiment analysis is a sentence level or document-level task. However, a sentence or paragraph may contain multiple target terms with different sentiments, making sentiment prediction more challenging. Although pre-trained language models like BERT have been successful, incorporating dynamic semantic changes into aspect-based sentiment models remains difficult, especially for domain-specific sentiment analysis. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Term-Based Sentiment Analysis (TBSA), a novel method designed to learn Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) contexts based on a sustainability taxonomy for ESG aspect-oriented sentiment analysis. Notably, we introduce a technique enhancing the ESG term’s attention, inspired by the success of attention-based neural networks in machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and Computer Vision (Bello et al., 2019). It enables the proposed model to focus on a small region of the sentences at each step and to reweigh the crucial terms for a better understanding of the ESG aspect-aware sentiment. Beyond the novelty in the model design, we propose a new dataset of 125,000+ ESG analyst annotated data points for sustainability term based sentiment classification, which derives from historical sustainability corpus data and expertise acquired by development finance institutions. Our extensive experiments combining the new method and the new dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the Sustainability TBSA model with an accuracy of 91.30% (90% F1-score). Both internal and external business applications of our model show an evident potential for a significant positive impact toward furthering sustainable development goals (SDGs).",253554105,7,48,,

With practical applications in areas such as product reviews, food delivery evaluations, and public opinion monitoring, sentiment analysis plays a crucial role. This paper focuses on the application of fine-grained sentiment analysis in financial distress prediction (FDP) to enhance early warnings of the management status of companies. In previous studies, there has been a narrow emphasis on using document-level sentiment analysis to extract overall sentiment from text, overlooking the semantic nuances conveyed by sentiments. Therefore, this paper aims to extract fine-grained sentiments from the Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) of Chinese listed companies. The proposed model is based on a two-step framework, consisting of an unsupervised aspect-level financial sentiment extraction phase and a model validation phase. Specifically, the former is built on a deep learning model with an attention mechanism, conducting unsupervised aspect extraction, aspect identification, and aspect-level sentiment classification in a sequential manner to obtain fine-grained sentiments. The latter is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the newly acquired features on benchmark machine learning models, including SVM, DT, LR, CNN, and DNN. Experimental results reveal that MD&A predominantly covers eight types of aspects, including ownership, business scope, development, capital, sales, management, prizes, and probability.

The objective of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the narrative elements, particularly the sentiment, in VNRs in order to more effectively assess and support global SDG progress. A total of 232 VNRs from 166 countries are analyzed using Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to extract each country’s sentiment toward the 17 SDGs. The sentiment scores are then compared to the corresponding official UN SDG scores, and countries are grouped by their sentiment toward all 17 SDGs to identify potential common development pathways. The analysis uncovers a notable positive correlation between the reported sentiment and official SDG scores for SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), and a negative correlation for SDG 5 (gender equality). Conversely, this relationship is not significant for the majority of SDGs, suggesting that VNR narratives may not directly reflect actual progress. A t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) approach indicates a consistent sentiment score among developed countries. In contrast, there are greater differences in reporting sentiment among Emerging Markets, Frontier Markets, and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), where there is greater dispersion (especially among LDCs) and sentiment in reporting on SDG progress that appears to have changed from one reporting year to another.

10.3390/su172411128,From News to Knowledge: Leveraging AI and Knowledge Graphs for Real-Time ESG Insights,"Omar Mohmmed Hassan Nassar, Fahimeh Jafari, Chanchal Jain",Sustainability,2025,"Traditional Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) assessments rely heavily on corporate disclosures and third-party ratings, which are often delayed, inconsistent, and prone to bias. These limitations leave stakeholders without timely visibility into rapidly evolving ESG events. These assessment frameworks also fail to capture the dynamic nature of ESG issues reflected in public news media. This research addresses these limitations by proposing and implementing an automated framework utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Knowledge Graphs (KG), to analyse ESG news data for companies listed on major stock indices. The methodology involves several stages: collecting a registry of target companies; retrieving relevant news articles; applying Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and ESG domain classification; and constructing a linked property knowledge graph to structure the extracted information semantically. The framework culminates in an interactive dashboard for visualising and querying the resulting graph database. The resulting knowledge graph supports comparative inferential analytics across indices and sectors, uncovering divergent ESG sentiment profiles and thematic priorities that traditional reports overlook. The analysis also reveals comparative insights into sentiment trends and ESG focus areas across different exchanges and sectors, offering perspectives often missing from traditional methods. Findings indicate differing ESG sentiment profiles and thematic focuses between the UK (FTSE) and Australian (ASX) indices within the analysed dataset. This study confirms AI/KG’s potential for a modular, dynamic, and semantically rich ESG intelligence approach, transforming unstructured news into interconnected insights. Limitations and areas for future work, including model refinement and integration of financial data, are also discussed. This proposed framework augments traditional ESG evaluations with automated, scalable, and context-rich analysis.",294937804,0,6,,
